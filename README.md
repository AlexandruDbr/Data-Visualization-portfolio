In this project I used a SQL view containing aggregated data by country related to COVID-19 from 01/01/2020 to 12/31/2023. The underlying dataset of view is from a NGO called “Our World in Data”, which collects and makes available various datasets responding to different global issues, such as global warming, Covid-19, earthquakes, etc. This project intends to answer a few questions which I found interesting with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic using Power BI, such as:

    Which continents have an increased number of people over 64 years old? 
    
    Were these countries highly impacted compared to other countries with a smaller rate of seniors?

    How accessible were vaccines overall? Were the low income citizens provided the possibility of taking a vaccine shot?

    What is the vaccination rate (with at least 1 dose) per continent, sub-regions?
