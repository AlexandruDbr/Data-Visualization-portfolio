# Data Visualization Projects

In this repositiory you will find all the visualisation projects I have worked from 2023-03 to 2024.02. This portfolio serves as proof of my proficiency in using different data visualsiation techniques and DAX. <br>


### [1. Northwind Traders management report](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Maven-Market-dashboard.git)
This PowerBI report is developed for Northwind Traders, a global import - export company specializing in gourmet food products. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide the executive team insights into the company's performance across the following commercial key areas: sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping costs; as well as sales person performance at the global level and their sales, by country and product category. 


### [2. Maven Market dashboard](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Maven-Market-dashboard.git)
This Power BI report is for Maven Market, an international retail store company with multiple stores of different sizes opened in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide insights over their financial performance for the period 01/01/1998 and 12/31/1998.


### [3. Covid-19 impact analysis](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Covid-19-analysis.git)
In this project I used a SQL view containing aggregated data by country related to COVID-19 from 01/01/2020 until 12/31/2023. The underlying dataset of view is from a NGO called “Our World in Data”, who collects and makes available various datasets responding to different global issues, such as global warming, Covid-19, earthquakes, etc. This project intends to answer a few questions which I found interesting with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic using Power BI, such as:

    Has vaccination significantly reduced the incidence rate of COVID-19 overall?
    Which continents have an increased number of people over 69 years old? Were these countries highly impacted compared to other countries with a smaller rate of seniors?
    How accessible were vaccines overall? Were the low income citizens provided the possibility of taking a vaccine shot?
    What was the number of people vaccinated with at least 1 dose per continent?
    

### [4. Adventure Works Dashboard](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Adventure-Works-dashboard.git)
This report is for Adventure Works Cycles, a fictional retail company which sells bikes, bike components and accessories as well as cycling clothing. The scope of this project is to provide executive team 3 dashboars: <br>
    1. With the overview over revenue, orders, returns overall and by region and product category. <br>
    2. Product performance overall and between 01 January 2016 and 31 December 2017. <br>
